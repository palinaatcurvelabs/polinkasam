            <div class="about-content">
                <p>Thank you for visiting. At the age of 27, I finally figured out where my voice was coming from. It was inside of me. I just thought that in the age of possibilities, there is nothing easier than becoming your Tumblr dream from back when you were 13.</p>

                <p>I realized that all of my best dreams were lying in the age of 13, when I just started opening myself up to the world and watching YouTube, being on Instagram, then traveling the world. This is where I started discovering my true self and how I can actually be part of this world, because the internet gave me this opportunity. I always wanted to be one of its users, one of its parts.</p>

                <p>When I was even smaller, I thought that I belong on the stage, but that does not necessarily always have to be the truth. Sometimes you just want to share an article without performing live, while you talk to the people, while your audience is reading what you have to share with them. It would be nice, though, to have a play track, so maybe that function will also come into play, but for now this is the Lake of Commons, so called, our playground. A place where I share thoughts that perhaps will feel so universal, perhaps will feel really personal, but there is a place for everything to be.</p>

                <p>It was a lifelong path trying to understand which box I have to fit in and trying to restrict myself and adapt myself to certain communities, duties, and tasks, not knowing which one I really truly belong to, because everything was interesting. There was nothing that would display my diversity as well as the simple image that is so bizarre and colorful at the same time. It's dark but also really bright and saturated, showing how my inner world looks like. At the same time, at the moment of writing this, my inner world is really, really calm.</p>

                <p>One of the biggest reasons for me actually putting this out is finding my peace within myself and stepping my foot onto the ground and being part of the moment. That just lets me be who I am and does not stop me from creating and doing the things that I think I should do in that particular moment, which is eternal, which is every moment. That has to just be a mirror of myself. This is the true purpose.</p>

                <p>Maybe you will like reading this, maybe not, but you are truly welcome to be part of this experience, and I'm happy to have you here.</p>

                <p>love you all xxx</p>
