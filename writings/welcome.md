# Welcome to My Writings

This is a space for thoughts that need more than a caption. Some are finished, some are still finding their shape.

I write about things I'm trying to understand—ideas that won't let go, questions without clean answers, observations that feel true but haven't quite proven themselves yet.

No themes, no schedule. Just the slow work of thinking through writing.
