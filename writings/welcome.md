This is where your writing begins.

Add your blog entries as markdown files in the `writings/` folder, then add them to `writings/index.json` and they'll appear here automatically.

You can use **bold**, *italic*, and other simple formatting.

Each entry can have a title, date, and your content. Keep it simple and raw, just like journaling on paper.
