Here's how you add a new writing:

1. Create a new `.md` file in the `writings/` folder
2. Write your content using simple markdown
3. Add an entry to `writings/index.json` with the title, optional date, and filename
4. Commit and push to GitHub

That's it. Your words will appear on the site, framed by that paper texture you love.
